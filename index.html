					It has almost been 15 years since Peter Agre gained his nobel prize in chemistry, and the reason he gained this prize was due to his discovery of aquaporins. Today, I will discuss who Peter Agre his, how he discovered aquaporins, and why his discovery was so important.

				</p>
				<p>
					Peter’s childhood was notable. He lived in many places, but eventually he settled in Minnesota. Peter had some hardships along the way; when he was eight, his grandmother died, and his siblings were diagnosed with various illnesses. Other than that, his childhood was quite normal. Although he is smart, his academic success was not perfect, and often he would call out during class. While in high school, Peter went on a camping trip in Russia, where he soon developed many Bolshevik ideas. He published an underground newspaper which almost got him kicked out of school due to this being the height of the cold war, but nethertheless he graduated, and received his BA from Augsburg university in 1970. During his school period, he found a fascination with exploring the world, which lead to him wanting to pursue biology.
				</p>
				<p>
					After getting his BA, Peter was accepted into John Hopkins university, where the majority of his work was done. First, he received his MD at John Hopkins university, and after many years of work in places such as the Western Reserve University Hospitals and a Hematology-Oncology Fellowship at North Carolina, he returned to John Hopkins University. Since he was now very experienced, he was offered a faculty spot at John Hopkins University’s Hematology Division.

					During his work as a faculty, Peter first discovered aquaporins. While studying Rh antigens, he learned the molecular identity of Rh was unknown, although the polypeptide 32 kDa was known to be in Rh. After isolating the 32 kDa in order to find the structure of Rh, Peter realized another protein, 28 kDa, was also present with the kDa. With this knowledge, he decided to research further about the 28 kDa protein. Since the 28 kDa and 32 kDa were both able to be isolated using the same substance, Peter was able to extract this protein from the cell membranes. After isolating the protein, he realized it was very common. Cells were found to have around 200,000 of these proteins, and they were very abundant in the proximal tubule and the loop of Henle. Furthermore, many different parts of different animals contained this protein. Looking over all of his facts, Peter hypothesised that the 28 kDa might be a sort of channel. When showing his evidence to one of his colleagues, one of his colleagues suggested that the protein may be a water channel protein. Exited due to this discovery, Peter published his findings about “aquaporins”, the water channel protein.

					The discovery of the aquaporin was revolutionary. Aquaporins help water diffuse through the membrane because water cannot passively diffuse through the membrane, meaning anything that has to do with the water content of a cell has to due with aquaporins. For example, the aquaporins proteins help cells regulate osmotic pressure, which means that the aquaporins help keep the cell from becoming too hypertonic or hypotonic, meaning that aquaporins help freshwater cells from imploding by removing excess water that would make the cell explode from hypotonic pressure. With this knowledge, things such as how the cells of plants can absorb and store water in their central vacuole now can be explained; the aquaporins keep water inside the cell, and prevent it from going out. Another important thing aquaporins do is reabsorption in the loop of Henle. The loop of Henle’s job is to reabsorb water from filtration in the nephrons of the kidney, meaning the aquaporins are well suited for the job since they only carry water. Aquaporins can also help explain diseases such as cholera where water reabsorption is an issue.
				</p>

					In 2003, Peter won his nobel prize in chemistry due to his discovery of aquaporins, however there are many more applications for aquaporins. Many other scientists after Peter have isolated other types of aquaporins, such as ones found in the brain and in secretion glands. Along with this, there are many ways that humans could benefit from the discovery of aquaporins. There have been ideas to implement aquaporins in an industrial setting, which may help in things such as water filters or purifiers. Another place where aquaporins would be useful is in dialysis, where they could help reabsorb water when the patient’s kidney has failed. In conclusion, Peter’s discovery of the aquaporin is very revolutionary, and the full extent of his discovery is still being explored to this day.
